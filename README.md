# Hotel App

A scalable application made for Travel Lodge with microservices<br />

As per the requirement and to improve the scalability of the application I have used microservices architecture when building the project<br />
For the backend development I have used Apollo Federation with nodejs as Apollo plays a leading role when comes to graphql. And Apollo Federation provides tons of scalability along with simplicity. We can share data between our services without any hustle. <br />
As per Databases I have used a noSQL database as they provides horizontal scaling and tons of flexibility. For this purpose I have took mongoDB cloud. <br />
For the frontend, I have choose micro frontend architecture as well because it gives scalabilty and sharing components, data and easy to collaborate with multiple teams. For Microfrontend I have choosen Single-SPA. It allows to work with multiple frameworks for different services without worring much on intergration. Single-SPA uses runtime Intergration via script so it is super flexible. <br />
For this project I have used only react for all services and Apollo client for communication with our graphql backend, styled-components for themeing and styles. <br />
